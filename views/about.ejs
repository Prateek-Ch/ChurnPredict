        This website is meant to show the churn prediction for a banking application. 
        The dataset that was used was details of several customers of a bank. We trained
        our dataset on different machine learning models like logistic regression, 
        Naive Bayes, Random forest, K nearest neighbour, decision tree classifier, 
        support vector machine and Random forest model.
        Upon implementing these models with the dataset, we inferred that the random 
        forest model gave the best accuracy of 95.6 and since it gives out the most 
        accurate result for churn prediction, we will use the random forest method.

        The fact that the random forest model gives the best results with the most
        accuracy, it can be implemented with different datasets for different 
        industries and thus will them to identify and stop customer churn.
